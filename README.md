GlobalTablist
=============

**Get back the global tablist**


This is a simple plugin for BungeeCord to get back the global userlist which has been disabled in the 1.8 protocol update. It just shows the players and allows for some header/footer. If you want more control over the tablist use my other plugin BungeeTabListPlus.

**Requirements:**

 * BungeeCord build #996 or above
 * Yamler
